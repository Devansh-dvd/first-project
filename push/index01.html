  Bill MarK is an advanced expense splitting and payment platform where users can sign up,

  log in, and enter their bank UPI IDs and QR codes. The app allows users to record shared
  
  expenses, calculate individual shares, and directly pay others using integrated UPI payment
  
  APIs—eliminating the need for third-party UPI apps. With secure storage of API keys and
  
  user payment details, Bill MarK enables seamless in-app payments through services like
  
  Razorpay or PhonePe. The project combines user authentication, expense tracking, and
  
  direct UPI transactions into a single, smart solution for managing group expenses.
  
  In addition to splitting group expenses, Bill Mark also tracks all kinds of payments, whether 
  
  they are shared (group/party expenses) or self-managed (individual expenses). Users can
  
  enter quants (quantity-based expenses) or direct self-payments, making it versatile for all
  
  types of spending scenarios. The platform organizes all transactions neatly, helping users
  
  monitor where and how their money is spent over time.
  
  Bill Mark securely manages API keys and payment details to allow seamless in-app transactions 
  
  through trusted UPI services.

        <pre>
    Bill MarK is necessary because it solves two major everyday problems:

    managing shared expenses and making direct payments easily — all inside

    a single platform.

    Normally, when friends, family, or colleagues split bills (like at restaurants, 

    trips, parties), they have to:

    1- Remember who paid for what

    2- Manually calculate who owes how much

    3- Switch to separate UPI apps (PhonePe, GPay) to send money

    4- Track payments separately

    This is messy, confusing, and time-consuming.

   5- Keeping a record of settlements for transparency
